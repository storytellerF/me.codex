# Client UI Best Practices Plugin

This Codex plugin provides client UI threading and state-driven rendering guidance. It defines a
platform-independent `Host` boundary that owns observable UI-ready state and asynchronous
business tasks, so feature behavior can be tested without a UI runtime.

## Contents

- `plugin.json` declares the portable plugin and client extensions.
- `skills/client-ui-best-practices/SKILL.md` defines main-thread boundaries, a `hostScope` confined to an injected custom serial dispatcher, explicit Default/IO switching, state/effect collection, and UI-free Host tests.
- `agents/client-ui-architecture-reviewer.md` reviews state ownership, Host boundaries, scheduling, lifecycle, and testability; the parent waits for its final report before editing or responding.

## Local Marketplace Entry

The repository marketplace registers this plugin as `client-ui-best-practices` at `./plugins/client-ui-best-practices`.

## Plugin packaging

`plugin.json` is the portable metadata source. Client manifests and complete skill resources are generated into `me.claude` and `me.codex`; install from those repositories. Source skills use portable frontmatter. Claude routing is stored in `extensions.com.anthropic.claude.skillFrontmatter`, keyed by skill directory, and injected only into generated Claude skills. Codex skill files are copied unchanged.
