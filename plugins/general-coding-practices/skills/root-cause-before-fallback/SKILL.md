# Root Cause Before Fallback

Fix the underlying problem before adding defensive layers.

## Rules

- Identify the essential root cause before choosing a fix.
- Reproduce or localize the failure when practical, using logs, tests, traces, diffs, or minimal examples.
- Add fallbacks, guards, retries, defaults, or workarounds only after deciding they are justified by the root cause.
- Prefer fixes that remove the bad state or broken assumption over fixes that merely hide the symptom.
- When a workaround is necessary, keep it narrow and document the condition that makes it necessary.
