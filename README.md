# me.codex

Codex-compatible packages generated from the portable Agent Plugins source repository
[`storytellerF/me`](https://github.com/storytellerF/me). Do not edit generated
plugin files here; make changes in the source repository and regenerate this
repository. Synchronization pull requests are created only by the source repository workflow.

## Installation

Add this repository as a Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/storytellerF/me.codex.git
```

Install the plugins you need from the `me` marketplace. For example:

```bash
codex plugin add android-emulator-profile@me
codex plugin add general-coding-practices@me
codex plugin add diff-sharing@me
```

Start a new Codex task after installation so its plugin skills are loaded.
